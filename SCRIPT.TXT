## ODev
## Prepare a shell script to do the following;

## 1. Will look for a file in linux and echo if file is missing

## 2. If file is there will pick the properties (env=development)

## 3. Will use options for executing  




if test -f "varmiyokmu.txt"; then
    open varmiyokmu.txt
    else 
 echo "varmiyokmu.txt does not exist"
fi



#Some tasks:
#if number of files .py more than 1 echo to exist code shoudl be 0 other wise 1
# change the behavior of code depending on the arguments passed into the shell script
# save it as .sh and how do you run it on windows?
